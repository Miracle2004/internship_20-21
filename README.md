Bioinformatic internship - Spider Silk Motif Finding
This repository is for the BridgeUp scholars in my 2020-2021 computational biology internship. Uploaded will be session information, notes and project code. We meet twice weekly to learn and discuss new coding concepts that will be applied to our biological problem. We are working to understand the evolutionary relationshionship between spider silk protein repeat patterns. We are coding in python to create educational algorithms capable of isolating repeats based on a kmer approach.
